Reporting parties shall be encouraged to obtain legal custody as soon as possible; however, since the safety of the missing child(ren) is paramount, a case will be opened when it can be shown the child has been removed, without explanation, from his or her usual place of residence. If custody has not been established by the Court, law enforcement's only responsibility is to ensure the child is safe.</p>

                <p>If the person is determined to be missing, the TMBCI LEA shall enter identifying and descriptive information about the person into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) data system within the first two hours of receipt of the initial report.

                <p>The TERO office may revoke a childcare center's license for noncompliance with any of the regulations set out in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/18.05" title="Chapter 18.05 Licensure and Regulations of Child Care Centers">this chapter</a>. The revocation of a childcare license, provisional or temporary, may be appealed to the TERO Commission. The child care center may continue to operate the child care center pending a determination by the TERO Commission, or until such time as the license expires of its own accord, whichever occurs first. A center may not appeal the expiration of a provisional license.</p>

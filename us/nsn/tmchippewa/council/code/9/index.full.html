                <p>Preamble. It is the policy of the Judicial Branch of Government of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa to pronounce that every parent owes a duty to his/her child to provide support. Every child has a right to support from their parent whether or not the parent is present or absent. This right to support cannot be abrogated by agreement of the parents by contract, settlement or stipulation in any court decree. Furthermore, as a matter of law, it is proclaimed to be in the best interest of children to be supported by their parents. Support payments established by the Judicial Branch of Government under this policy are deemed minimums. Payments for the support of children may exceed these standards based upon the parent's ability to pay but may not be less than those payment levels established under this policy. Actual cash payments are based upon the parent's ability to pay as determined by their net income with allowances for authorized adjustments and special consideration that the court may find appropriate. Furthermore, it is expressly understood that support payments may be further reduced by the provision of clothing, food or other item necessary for the maintenance of the child by the parent required to pay child support as provided in these under this policy.</p>

Examples include money in savings or checking accounts, trust land, tax land, vehicles, farm equipment, jewelry, business interests, loan value of insurance policies, stocks, bonds and other securities, and money or things owed by others to the parent.</p>

Examples include a absent parent supporting one child will be required to pay 15% of their income to support that child A parent supporting two children, 19% of their net income, three children, 22% of their net income, four children 25% of their net income, five children 28% of their net income, six children 31% of their net income, seven children 34% of their net income, eight children 35% of their net income, nine children 35% of their net income, etc. These percentages shall not be diminished due to remarriage or the parenting of other children. The above percentage may be reduced in any month in which the parent to whom child support is ordered furnishes things necessary for the child such as clothing, food or other item. This reduction, however, shall not exceed 20% of the total cash obligation of the parent. When all of the children to which support is being sought are from the same family, the maximum net income subject to child support shall be 35%. When support is sought for children from more than one family, the maximum net income subject to child support shall be 50% with all first children of each family being financially supported equally. The first child in each family will be supported at 10% of net income. This example will result in 20% of net income assessed for two children in separate families with each child supported at 10%, three children in separate families, 30% of net income with each child supported at 10% etc. For each additional child in the same family, an additional 4% of net income will be assessed for child support for that family.</p>

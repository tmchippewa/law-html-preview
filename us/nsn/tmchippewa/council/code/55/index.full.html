Both the United States Congress, through its enactment of the Tribal General Welfare Exclusion Act of 2014, and the Internal Revenue Service, through its traditional application of the general welfare doctrine, have long recognized the sovereign right of Indian tribal governments to provide financial assistance to individuals under certain circumstances on a non-taxable basis. <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/55" title="Title 55 General Welfare Exclusion">This Title</a> is intended to affirm the Tribe's inherent sovereign rights to promote the general welfare of the Tribe and provide qualifying assistance and program benefits on a tax free basis. In this regard, the Constitution of the Tribe confirms the sovereign duty and responsibility of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians to maintain the culture and independence of its members, to encourage the economic well-being of its members, and to promote the rights of its members and their common welfare. The Assistance authorized by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/55" title="Title 55 General Welfare Exclusion">this Title</a> is intended to qualify for tax free treatment to the fullest extent permitted at law.

On December 5, 2011, the United States Treasury Department and IRS published Notice 2011-94 as part of an initiative to conduct consultation on ways to improve guidance on tribal general welfare matters. Notice 2011-94 invited comments from tribal governments concerning the application of the general welfare exclusion to Indian tribal government programs.</p>

On September 17, 2014, Senators Moran and Heitkamp, co-sponsors of S.B. 1507, engaged in a colloquy with the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, on the Congressional Record of the Senate confirming their understanding and intent that:</p>

                <p>Programs that do not qualify for non-taxable treatment under IRS Code Section 139E or under an IRS Safe Harbor, will nonetheless be treated as non-taxable if Program benefits meet the General Test for treatment under the General Welfare Exclusion. For purposes of the General Test only, needs must be shown in one of the following manners:</p>

Certain Programs may be based on individual need, rather than an overall need of the Tribe. For those Programs, the Tribal Council may establish income guidelines unique to the Tribe or may use readily available income guidelines used by state or federal programs to demonstrate individual or family need. When individual or family need must be shown, the Program may take into account individual circumstances or extraordinary need to overcome presumptions based on income alone.</p>

Certain Programs may be based on community needs, which are so important to the self-nation culture and traditions of the Tribe that Assistance may be deemed necessary regardless of individual income or wealth. For example, states provide public education to all citizens regardless of individual income or wealth. Some Programs may address both individual and community-based needs. The Council reserves the right to require any applicant applying for consideration based on non-financial or community-based needs to demonstrate how the Program benefits will benefit the tribal community as a whole, including preservation of culture, tradition and self-determination. Approval based on non-financial need criteria is made on a facts and circumstances basis and will be guided by traditional values and culture. A Program will be deemed to be based on community or non-financial needs if so designated by the Council.</p>

The federal government, as a result of its treaty obligations and trust responsibility, has committed to providing education, housing, clean water, and many other basic needs for Indian people. Through a conscientious shift in policy in recent decades, the federal government has encouraged the Tribe itself to provide for such needs in partnership with the federal government and, increasingly in recent years, instead of the federal government. Essential to the government-to-government relationship is mutual respect and deference to Tribal governance decisions. Future consultations on General Welfare matters should reflect these concerns and the fact that the Tribal government, through its own policy setting process, is best situated to determine the needs of the Tribe and its Members and the appropriate policy solutions. All references to Executive Order 13175 shall include any future amendments thereto.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Applicability of other rules.  These rules govern proceedings to condemn real and personal property by eminent domain, except as this rule provides otherwise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Joinder of properties.  The plaintiff may join separate pieces of property in a single action, no matter whether they are owned by the same persons or sought for the same use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Complaint.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Caption.</em> the complaint must contain a caption as provided in rule 10(a). the plaintiff must, however, name as defendants both the property—designated generally by kind, quantity, and location—and at least one owner of some part of or interest in the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Contents.</em> the complaint must contain a short and plain statement of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(A)">(A)</span> the authority for the taking;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(B)">(B)</span> the uses for which the property is to be taken;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(C)">(C)</span> a description sufficient to identify the property;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(D)">(D)</span> the interests to be acquired; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)(E)">(E)</span> for each piece of property, a designation of each defendant who has been joined as an owner or owner of an interest in it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> <em>Parties.</em> When the action commences, the plaintiff need join as defendants only those persons who have or claim an interest in the property and whose names are then known. But before any hearing on compensation, the plaintiff must add as defendants all those persons who have or claim an interest and whose names have become known or can be found by a reasonably diligent search of the records, considering both the property's character and value and the interests to be acquired. All others may be made defendants under the designation "Unknown Owners."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> <em>Procedure.</em> Notice must be served on all defendants as provided in Rule 71.1(d), whether they were named as defendants when the action commenced or were added later. A defendant may answer as provided in Rule 71.1(e). The court, meanwhile, may order any distribution of a deposit that the facts warrant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> <em>Filing; Additional Copies.</em> In addition to filing the complaint, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy for the defendants' use and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Process.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> <em>Delivering Notice to the Clerk.</em> On filing a complaint, the plaintiff must promptly deliver to the clerk joint or several notices directed to the named defendants. When adding defendants, the plaintiff must deliver to the clerk additional notices directed to the new defendants.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> <em>Contents of the Notice.</em></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Main Contents.</em> Each notice must name the court, the title of the action, and the defendant to whom it is directed. It must describe the property sufficiently to identify it, but need not describe any property other than that to be taken from the named defendant. The notice must also state:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(A)">(A)</span> that the action is to condemn property;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(B)">(B)</span> the interest to be taken;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(C)">(C)</span> the authority for the taking;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(D)">(D)</span> the uses for which the property is to be taken;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(E)">(E)</span> that the defendant may serve an answer on the plaintiff's attorney within 21 days after being served with the notice;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(F)">(F)</span> that the failure to so serve an answer constitutes consent to the taking and to the court's authority to proceed with the action and fix the compensation; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(1)(G)">(G)</span> that a defendant who does not serve an answer may file a notice of appearance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(f)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Conclusion.</em> The notice must conclude with the name, telephone number, and e-mail address of the plaintiff's attorney and an address within the district in which the action is brought where the attorney may be served.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> <em>Serving the Notice.</em></p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Personal Service.</em> When a defendant whose address is known resides within the United States or a territory subject to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the United States, personal service of the notice (without a copy of the complaint) must be made in accordance with Rule 4.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Service by Publication.</em></p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)(A)">(A)</span> A defendant may be served by publication only when the plaintiff's attorney files a certificate stating that the attorney believes the defendant cannot be personally served, because after diligent inquiry within the state where the complaint is filed, the defendant's place of residence is still unknown or, if known, that it is beyond the territorial limits of personal service. Service is then made by publishing the notice—once a week for at least 3 successive weeks—in a newspaper published in the county where the property is located or, if there is no such newspaper, in a newspaper with general circulation where the property is located. Before the last publication, a copy of the notice must also be mailed to every defendant who cannot be personally served but whose place of residence is then known. Unknown owners may be served by publication in the same manner by a notice addressed to "Unknown Owners."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)(B)">(B)</span> Service by publication is complete on the date of the last publication. The plaintiff's attorney must prove publication and mailing by a certificate, attach a printed copy of the published notice, and mark on the copy the newspaper's name and the dates of publication.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(h)">(h)</span> <em>Effect of Delivery and Service.</em> Delivering the notice to the clerk and serving it have the same effect as serving a summons under Rule 4.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(i)">(i)</span> <em>Amending the Notice; Proof of Service and Amending the Proof.</em> Rule 4(a)(2) governs amending the notice. Rule 4(<em>l</em>) governs proof of service and amending it.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(j)">(j)</span> Appearance or Answer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Notice of Appearance.</em> A defendant that has no objection or defense to the taking of its property may serve a notice of appearance designating the property in which it claims an interest. The defendant must then be given notice of all later proceedings affecting the defendant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Answer.</em> A defendant that has an objection or defense to the taking must serve an answer within 21 days after being served with the notice. The answer must:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(A)">(A)</span> identify the property in which the defendant claims an interest;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(B)">(B)</span> state the nature and extent of the interest; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(2)(C)">(C)</span> state all the defendant's objections and defenses to the taking.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(j)(3)">(3)</span> <em>Waiver of Other Objections and Defenses; Evidence on Compensation.</em> A defendant waives all objections and defenses not stated in its answer. No other pleading or motion asserting an additional objection or defense is allowed. But at the trial on compensation, a defendant—whether or not it has previously appeared or answered—may present evidence on the amount of compensation to be paid and may share in the award.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(k)">(k)</span> Amending Pleadings. Without leave of court, the plaintiff may—as often as it wants—amend the complaint at any time before the trial on compensation. But no amendment may be made if it would result in a dismissal inconsistent with the Rules herein. The plaintiff need not serve a copy of an amendment, but must serve notice of the filing, as provided in within <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/2" title="Title 2 Judicial Procedure, Civil">this title</a>, on every affected party who has appeared on every affected party who has not appeared. In addition, the plaintiff must give the clerk at least one copy of each amendment for the defendants' use, and additional copies at the request of the clerk or a defendant. A defendant may appear or answer in the time and manner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(l)">(l)</span> Substituting Parties. If a defendant dies, becomes incompetent, or transfers an interest after being joined, the court may, on motion and notice of hearing, order that the proper party be substituted. Service of the motion and notice on a nonparty must be made as provided herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(m)">(m)</span> Trial of the Issues.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Issues Other Than Compensation; Compensation.</em> In an action involving eminent domain under the Tribe's law the court tries all issues.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(m)(2)">(2)</span> The Court shall appoint an Expert Witness to assess the value of the property at the Cost of the party seeking condemnation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(n)">(n)</span> Dismissal of the Action or a Defendant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Dismissing the Action.</em></p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(1)(A)">(A)</span> <em>By the Plaintiff.</em> If no compensation hearing on a piece of property has begun, and if the plaintiff has not acquired title or a lesser interest or taken possession, the plaintiff may, without a court order, dismiss the action as to that property by filing a notice of dismissal briefly describing the property.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(1)(B)">(B)</span> <em>By Stipulation.</em> Before a judgment is entered vesting the plaintiff with title or a lesser interest in or possession of property, the plaintiff and affected defendants may, without a court order, dismiss the action in whole or in part by filing a stipulation of dismissal. And if the parties so stipulate, the court may vacate a judgment already entered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(1)(C)">(C)</span> <em>By Court Order.</em> At any time before compensation has been determined and paid, the court may, after a motion and hearing, dismiss the action as to a piece of property. But if the plaintiff has already taken title, a lesser interest, or possession as to any part of it, the court must award compensation for the title, lesser interest, or possession taken.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Dismissing a Defendant.</em> The court may at any time dismiss a defendant who was unnecessarily or improperly joined.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(n)(3)">(3)</span> <em>Effect.</em> A dismissal is without prejudice unless otherwise stated in the notice, stipulation, or court order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(o)">(o)</span> Deposit and Its Distribution.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(o)(1)">(1)</span> <em>Deposit.</em> The plaintiff must deposit with the court any money required by law as a condition to the exercise of eminent domain and may make a deposit when allowed by statute.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(o)(2)">(2)</span> <em>Distribution; Adjusting Distribution.</em> After a deposit, the court and attorneys must expedite the proceedings so as to distribute the deposit and to determine and pay compensation. If the compensation finally awarded to a defendant exceeds the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against the plaintiff for the deficiency. If the compensation awarded to a defendant is less than the amount distributed to that defendant, the court must enter judgment against that defendant for the overpayment.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(p)">(p)</span> Costs may be awarded.</p>

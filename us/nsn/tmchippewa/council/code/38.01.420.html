                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> The Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department may issue, for a fee per year or part of a year, a special identifying certificate to any mobility impaired applicant upon submission by the applicant of a completed application and a written statement issued by a qualified physician to the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department that the applicant is a mobility- impaired person within the criteria of Subsection (b). The Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department shall waive the requirement for a written statement from a qualified physician if the applicant has previously submitted an application containing certification that the impairment is not reversible. The application must include the information required by the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department. The physician's statement must describe how the impairment limits the applicant's mobility and daily life functions of the applicant. The certificate is valid for a period, not to exceed three years, as determined by the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department. A Physician who provides a false statement that a person is mobility impaired for the purpose of that person to obtain the certificate under this subsection is guilty of an infraction for which a minimum fine of one hundred dollars must be imposed. A certificate issued under this subsection must be 5 inches in height and 3.5 inches in width and must bear, in white (color) on blue (color), the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility impaired. The certificate must bear the expiration date and registration number assigned by the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department. This Department shall adopt rules governing the issuance of the certificate. A temporary certificate valid for an initial period not to exceed three (3) months may be issued by this Department for a fee of three dollars ($3) upon application supported by a physician's statement. One additional temporary certificate may be issued if lost, stolen or mutilated for a cost three dollars ($3). The temporary certificate may be extended an additional period, not to exceed three months, upon application supported by a physician's statement that the extension is warranted. Temporary certificates will measure 5 inches in height and 3.5 inches in width and white on blue (color).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> A certificate issued under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/38.01.420" title="38.01.420 Parking Privileges for Mobility Impaired; Certification Revocations; Ongoing Appropriations; Penalties">this section</a> must be hung from the rearview mirror of the motor vehicle whenever the vehicle is occupying a space reserved for the mobility impaired and is being used by a mobility impaired or another person for the purposes of transporting the mobility- impaired person. No part of the certificate must be obscured. A fee of five dollars ($5) may be imposed for a violation of this Subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> An applicant may appeal a decision denying issuance of the certificate to the Director of the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department. Written notice of the appeal must be received within ten business days following receipt by the applicant of notice of denial. The applicant has sixty (60) days to provide additional supportive materials to the Director for purposes of deciding the appeal. The Director shall affirm or reverse the decision to deny issuance of the certificate within thirty days after receipt of the supportive material. Written notice of the decision must be given to the applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If a law enforcement officer finds that the certificate is being improperly used, the officer may report to the Turtle Mountain Motor Vehicle Department any such violation, and this Department may remove the privilege. Any person who is not mobility-impaired and who exercises the privilege granted a mobility-impaired person under subsection (a) is guilty of an infraction for which a fine of one hundred dollars ($100) must be imposed.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Whenever any public or private entity designates parking spaces for use by motor vehicles operated by mobility-impaired persons, those reserved spaces must comply with the requirements of the American with Disabilities Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities as contained in the appendix to Title 28, Code of Federal Regulations, part 36 (28 CFR 36) and must be indicated by blue paint on the curb or edge of the paved portion of the street or parking lot adjacent to the space. In addition to blue paint, each reserved space must be indicated by an official sign bearing the internationally accepted symbol of access for the mobility-impaired. The sign must indicate that unauthorized use of the space is a non-moving violation for which a fee of one hundred dollars must be imposed. For particular events, a public or private entity may reserve additional parking spaces. In that case, each temporarily reserved space must be indicated by a sign or other suitable means. A sign indicating that a space is reserved for the mobility-impaired and blue paint on the curb or edge of the paved portion of the street or parking lot adjacent to the space, unless the space is a temporary mobility-impaired parking space, is sufficient basis for the enforcement of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/38.01.420" title="38.01.420 Parking Privileges for Mobility Impaired; Certification Revocations; Ongoing Appropriations; Penalties">this section</a>.

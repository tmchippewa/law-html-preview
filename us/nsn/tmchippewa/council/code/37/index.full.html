                <p>Domestic violence is a serious problem that is not in any way culturally sanctioned.  The Turtle Mountain Domestic Violence Code intends to promulgate a responsible Tribal response to domestic violence. The Tribe intends to communicate that domestic violence represents an aberration and danger to the mental, physical and cultural well-being of the Tribe and Tribal members. It is also the intent of the Tribe that victims of domestic violence receive the maximum assistance and protection under the law and to hold perpetrators accountable for their conduct.</p>

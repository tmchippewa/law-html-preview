                <p>All food in food-service establishments shall be from sources approved or considered satisfactory by the health authority, and shall be clean, wholesome, free from spoilage, free from adulteration and misbranding, and safe for human consumption. No hermetically sealed, nonacid, and low-acid food which has been processed in a place other than a commercial food-processing establishment shall be used.</p>
                <p>Reason: To control food-borne illness and food spoilage, which may result from improperly processed or handled food, the food-service establishment must be concerned with the sources of food which are to be used. The safety and wholesomeness of food is a basic requirement for the protection of the consumer's health. Accordingly, the provisions listed under "Compliance" are intended to insure that food in general, as well as certain food which may be potentially hazardous, is obtained from sources which have been approved or are considered satisfactory by the health authority.</p>
                <p>The use of non-commercially processed, hermetically sealed, nonacid, and low-acid food, i.e., food with a pH of more than 4.5, is prohibited because of the history of such food in causing botulism, a type of food poisoning which is frequently fatal.

                <p>It is the policy of the Turtle Mountain Tribal Council to promote employment opportunities for Indians and business opportunities for Indian firms and contractors, and to provide direction, management and business standards for the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation.  The work force of the Tribe must be given an opportunity to gain employment on or off the reservation and the Tribal council will promote that preference in harmony with congressional enactments giving Indians special employment rights.  It is also the Council's responsibility to monitor Indian preference along with collecting from those doing business on the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation a fair fee for that privilege.  Thus, the Tribal Council has enacted and hereby amends an ordinance called "Tribal Employment Rights Ordinance (TERO)."</p>

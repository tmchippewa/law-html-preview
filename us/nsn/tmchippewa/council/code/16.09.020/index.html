                <p>All food while being stored, prepared, displayed, served, or sold at food-service establishments, or during transportation between such establishments, shall be protected from contamination. All perishable food shall be stored at such temperatures as will protect against spoilage. All potentially hazardous food shall be maintained at safe temperatures (45 degrees F. or below, or 140 degrees F. or above), except during necessary periods of preparation and service. Raw fruits and vegetables shall be washed before use. Stuffings, poultry, stuffed meats and poultry and pork and pork products shall be thoroughly cooked before being served. Individual portions of food once served to the customer shall not be served again provided: that wrapped food which has not been unwrapped and which is wholesome may be re-served.</p>
                <p>Only such poisonous and toxic materials as are required to maintain sanitary conditions and for sanitization purposes may be used or stored in food-service establishments. Poisonous and toxic materials shall be identified, and shall be used only in such manner and under such conditions as will not contaminate food or constitute a hazard to employees or customers.</p>
                <p>Reason: Wholesome food, if mishandled, can become contaminated from a number of sources. Food protection measures are designed to eliminate the contamination of food from any source within the establishment, and to prevent the growth of disease-producing organisms, and the production of bacterial toxins, in the event that pathogens are present in the food.</p>
                <p>Proper food-protection measures should include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> strict observation of personal hygiene by all food-service employees;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> keeping potentially hazardous food refrigerated or heated at all times to temperatures which preclude the growth of any pathogenic organisms which may be present;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> application of good sanitation practices in the storage, preparation, display, and service of food;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> adequate cooking of certain food of animal origin to assure destruction of pathogenic organisms which may be present;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(e)">(e)</span> thorough washing of fruits and vegetables; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> the provision of adequate equipment and facilities for the proper conduct of operations. In addition, food must be protected against accidental contamination with any toxic substance.</p>
                <p>Compliance: This subsection shall be deemed to have been satisfied when the following requirements are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> General:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> All food, while being stored, prepared, displayed, served, or sold in food service establishments, or transported between such establishments, shall be protected against contamination from dust, flies, rodents, and other vermin; unclean utensils and work surfaces; unnecessary handling; coughs and sneezes; flooding, drainage, and overhead leakage; and any other source.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> Conveniently located refrigeration facilities, hot food storage and display facilities, and effective insulated facilities, shall be provided as needed to assure the maintenance of all food at required temperatures during storage, preparation, display, and service.

                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(h)(5)(B)">(B)</span> Pre-chilled to a temperature of 45 degrees F. or below, when placed on display for service, and the food temperature shall at no time during the display period exceed 55 degrees F.</p>

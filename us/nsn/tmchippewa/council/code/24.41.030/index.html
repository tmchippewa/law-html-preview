                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> An issuer to whom a certificated security is presented for registration shall inquire into adverse claims if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(1)">(1)</span> a written notification of an adverse claim is received at a time and in a manner affording the issuer a reasonable opportunity to act on it prior to the issuance of a new, reissued, or reregistered certificated security, and the notification identifies the claimant, the registered owner, and the issue of which the security is a part, and provides an address for communications directed to the claimant; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(a)(2)">(2)</span> the issuer is charged with notice of an adverse claim from a controlling instrument it has elected to require under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.41.020#(d)" title="">Section 24.41.020(d)</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> The issuer may discharge any duty of inquiry by any reasonable means, including notifying an adverse claimant by registered or certified mail at the address furnished by him or her or, if there be no such address, at his or her residence or regular place of business that the certificated security has been presented for registration of transfer by a named person, and that the transfer will be registered unless within thirty (30) days from the date of mailing the notification, either:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> there is filed with the issuer an indemnity bond, sufficient in the issuer's judgment to protect the issuer and any transfer agent, registrar, or other agent of the issuer involved from any loss it or they may suffer by complying with the adverse claim.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> an issuer registering transfer on an endorsement by a fiduciary is not bound to inquire whether the transfer is made in compliance with a controlling instrument or with the law of the jurisdiction having jurisdiction of the fiduciary relationship, including any law requiring the fiduciary to obtain court approval of the transfer; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> the issuer is not charged with notice of the contents of any court record or file or other recorded or unrecorded document even though the document is in its possession and even though the transfer is made on the endorsement of a fiduciary to the fiduciary himself or to his or her nominee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> An issuer is under no duty as to adverse claims with respect to an uncertificated security except:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> claims embodied in a restraining order, injunction, or other legal process served upon the issuer if the process was served at a time and in a manner affording the issuer a reasonable opportunity to act on it in accordance with the requirements of Subsection (e);</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(1)">(1)</span> including a notation of the claim in any statements sent with respect to the security under Subsections (c), (f), and (g) of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.41.080" title="24.41.080 Statements of Uncertificated Securities">Section 24.41.080</a>; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(e)(2)">(2)</span> refusing to register the transfer or pledge of the security unless the nature of the claim does not preclude transfer or pledge subject thereto.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(f)">(f)</span> If the transfer or pledge of the security is registered subject to an adverse claim, a notation of the claim must be included in the initial transaction statement and all subsequent statements sent to the transferee and pledgee under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.41.080" title="24.41.080 Statements of Uncertificated Securities">Section 24.41.080</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(g)">(g)</span> Notwithstanding Subsections (d) and (e), if an uncertificated security was subject to a registered pledge at the time the issuer first came under a duty as to a particular adverse claim, the issuer has no duty as to that claim if transfer of the security is requested by the registered pledgee or an appropriate person acting for the registered pledgee unless:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(1)">(1)</span> the claim was embodied in legal process which expressly provides otherwise;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(2)">(2)</span> the claim was asserted in a written notification from the registered pledgee;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(3)">(3)</span> the claim was one as to which the issuer was charged with notice from a controlling instrument it required under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.41.020#(d)" title="">Section 24.41.020(d)</a> in connection with the pledgee's request for transfer; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(g)(4)">(4)</span> the transfer requested is to the registered owner.</p>

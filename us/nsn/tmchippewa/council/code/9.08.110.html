                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Statute of Limitations. Paternity may be established in an action brought in the Turtle Mountain Tribal Court by the natural mother, putative father, or custodian or guardian until the child reaches the age of 18 years. Any action previously barred by tribal statute of limitations less than 18 years may also be maintained under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/9.08.110" title="9.08.110 Paternity; Establishment of">this section</a> provided the cause of action accrued less than 18 years from the time of filing. A child may bring an action to establish paternity at any time within the child's life for the limited purpose of establishing enrollment with the Tribe. This action may be brought against the putative father or the estate of the putative father if deceased, but any finding of the Court with regard to paternity shall only impact the child's eligibility for enrollment and will not support the reopening of any concluded probate proceedings or any action for back child support. Plaintiff shall establish by clear and convincing evidence that the person is the father.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(b)">(b)</span> Jurisdiction. The Turtle Mountain Tribal Court shall have jurisdiction over any paternity action where:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(1)">(1)</span> A party to the action has resided on the reservation for 90 days prior to commencement of the action; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(2)">(2)</span> A party to the action is an enrolled member of the Tribe or an enrolled member of any other federally Recognized Indian tribe; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(3)">(3)</span> The conception of the child for whom establishment of paternity is sought occurred within the exterior boundaries of the reservation; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(b)(4)">(4)</span> The child for whom establishment of paternity is sought was born within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, on trust land held by any tribal member wherever located or on tribal land whether currently or subsequently acquired;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(c)">(c)</span> Genetic Testing</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(1)">(1)</span> Any party, which requests a genetic test, must file the request with a supporting sworn statement either alleging or denying paternity. The Tribal Court may order a genetic test based upon a motion by any party which either alleges paternity and sets forth facts which establish a reasonable possibility of the requisite sexual contact between the parties or denies paternity and sets forth a reasonable possibility of no sexual contact between the parties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(2)">(2)</span> The Tribal child support enforcement agency created herein must pay for all court ordered tests in those cases where the custodial parent is receiving TANF and allow for additional testing only upon request by a party and advance payment for the costs. The Tribe is entitled to recover the costs of these tests from the father if paternity is established. The Tribe is entitled to recover the costs of these tests from the mother if the court determines that the claim of paternity was not based on good faith in cases where paternity was not established. <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/9.08.110" title="9.08.110 Paternity; Establishment of">This section</a> does not apply to those cases brought to establish paternity for purposes of enrollment only.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(3)">(3)</span> The Tribal Court must admit accredited genetic test results into evidence without foundation and must limit objections to test results to fourteen (14) days before the paternity hearing or 14 days after receipt of the test results.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(4)">(4)</span> A rebuttable presumption of paternity is established where the genetic tests indicate a 96% threshold probability of paternity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(5)">(5)</span> Pregnancy and childbirth expenses, as well as genetic testing bills are admissible without foundation testimony and constitute prima facie evidence of costs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(d)">(d)</span> Acknowledgment In General. The relationship of father and child may be established by voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, signed by both parents, given before a witness if both A and B are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(1)">(1)</span> The acknowledgment is made on a form in substantial conformance with this subsection, which provides:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)">(2)</span> The witness, or any agent of a child support agency, verifies that the parents have been provided, before the acknowledgment of paternity is signed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(A)">(A)</span> Written materials about paternity establishment, including the manner in which the relationship of father and child established under this Act, may be vacated on the basis of fraud, duress; or mistake of fact; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(2)(B)">(B)</span> A written and oral description of the rights, responsibilities, and legal consequences of acknowledging paternity, including the legal rights of the child</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(3)">(3)</span> Acknowledgment becomes a legal finding of paternity in 60 days, thereafter subject to court challenge only on the basis of fraud, duress or mistake of fact.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(4)">(4)</span> The father's name can be on the birth certificate only if both parents sign an acknowledgement or pursuant to an order of the Court.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(d)(6)">(6)</span> The Tribe shall grant full faith and credit to the paternity affidavits and orders of other tribes and States, in compliance with 28 U.S.C. 1738B.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(14)">(14)</span> Failure to comply.

In addition, failure to comply will result in the revocation of the license of such animal resulting in the immediate removal of the animal from the reservation.</p>

Any person violating or permitting the violation of any provision of this ordinance shall, upon conviction in Tribal Court, be fined a sum not more than five hundred dollars ($500). In addition to the fine imposed, the Court may sentence the defendant to imprisonment for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.  In addition, the Court shall order the registration of the subject Pit Bull, Rottweiler or Doberman Pinscher revoked and the dog removed from the reservation. Should the defendant refuse to remove the dog from the reservation, the Tribal Judge shall find the defendant owner in contempt and order the immediate confiscation and impoundment of the animal. Each day that a violation of this ordinance continues shall be deemed a SEPARATE OFFENSE. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any person who violates this ordinance shall pay all expenses, including shelter, food, handling, veterinary care and testimony necessitated by the enforcement of this ordinance.</p>

No Pit Bull, Rottweiler or Doberman Pinscher dog may be kept on a porch, patio or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog to exit such building on its own volition. In addition, no such animal may be kept in a house or structure when the windows are open, or when screen windows or screen doors are the only obstacles preventing the dog from exiting the structure.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(14)">(14)</span> Failure to comply.

Any dog found to be the subject of a violation of this ordinance shall be subject to immediate seizure and impoundment. In addition, failure to comply will result in the revocation of the license of such animal resulting in the immediate removal of the animal from the reservation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(c)(15)">(15)</span> Violations and penalties. Any person violating or permitting the violation of any provision of this ordinance shall, upon conviction in Tribal Court, be fined a sum not more than five hundred dollars ($500). In addition to the fine imposed, the Court may sentence the defendant to imprisonment for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days.  In addition, the Court shall order the registration of the subject Pit Bull, Rottweiler or Doberman Pinscher revoked and the dog removed from the reservation. Should the defendant refuse to remove the dog from the reservation, the Tribal Judge shall find the defendant owner in contempt and order the immediate confiscation and impoundment of the animal. Each day that a violation of this ordinance continues shall be deemed a SEPARATE OFFENSE. In addition to the foregoing penalties, any person who violates this ordinance shall pay all expenses, including shelter, food, handling, veterinary care and testimony necessitated by the enforcement of this ordinance.</p>

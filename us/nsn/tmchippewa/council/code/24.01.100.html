                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(y)(1)">(1)</span> He or she has actual knowledge of it; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(y)(2)">(2)</span> He or she has received a notice or notification of it; or</p>

A person "receives" a notice or notification when it comes to his or her attention; or it is duly delivered at the place of business through which the contract was made or at any other place held out by him or her as the place for receipt of such communications. Notice, knowledge or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time when it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction, and in any event from the time when it would have been brought to his or her attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless such communication is part of his or her regular duties or unless he or she has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(bb)">(bb)</span> "ORGANIZATION" includes a corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, business trust, estate, trust, partnership or association, two or more persons having a joint or common interest, or any other legal or commercial entity.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(ee)">(ee)</span> "PRESUMPTION" or "PRESUMED" means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(ff)">(ff)</span> "PURCHASE" includes taking by sale, discount, negotiation, mortgage, pledge, lien, issue or reissue, gift or any other voluntary transaction creating an interest in property.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(hh)">(hh)</span> "REMEDY" means any remedial right to which an aggrieved party is entitled with or without resort to a tribunal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(ii)">(ii)</span> "REPRESENTATIVE" includes an agent, an officer of a corporation or association, and a trustee, executor or administrator of an estate, or any other person empowered to act for another.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(jj)">(jj)</span> "RIGHTS" includes remedies.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)">(kk)</span> "SECURITY INTEREST" means an interest in personal property or fixtures which secures payment or performance of an obligation. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer (<a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.06.030" title="24.06.030 Manner of Seller's Tender of Delivery">Section 24.06.030</a>) is limited in effect to a reservation of a "security interest." The term also includes any interest of a buyer of accounts or chattel paper which is subject to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.42" title="Chapter 24.42 Secured Transactions">Chapters 24.42</a> through <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.48" title="Chapter 24.48 Transition">24.48</a>. The special circumstances of a secured transaction must be treated in accordance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.42" title="Chapter 24.42 Secured Transactions">Chapters 24.42</a> through <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24.48" title="Chapter 24.48 Transition">24.48</a> of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/tmchippewa/council/code/24" title="Title 24 Commercial Code">this title</a>. Whether a transaction creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case; however, a transaction creates a security interest if the consideration the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease not subject to termination by the lessee, and:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)(1)">(1)</span> the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)(2)">(2)</span> the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods,</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)(3)">(3)</span> the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement, or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)(4)">(4)</span> the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement.</p>
                <p>A transaction does not create a security interest merely because it provides that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="(kk)(5)">(5)</span> the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into,</p>

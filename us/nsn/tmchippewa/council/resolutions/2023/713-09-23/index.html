                <p>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians (TMBCI) Chief of Police, hereinafter referred to as the Chief of Police, shall maintain a TMBCI missing and murdered person program within the TMBCI Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) to enable documented information about missing and murdered TMBCI persons to be entered into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) database.  The TMBCI LEA shall enter all TMBCI missing persons within two hours of the receipt of the initial report into the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>NCIC database</li>
                  <li>State law enforcement system</li>
                  <li>NamUs databases, and</li>
                  <li>ND Missing Person database</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The TMBCI LEA shall verify and update such records with any additional information, including, where available, medical and dental records and a photograph taken during the previous 180 days, no later than 30 days after the original entry of the record into the NCIC database, State law enforcement system, and the NamUs databases.</p>
                <p>The TMBCI LEA shall notify the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children of each report received relating to a child reported missing from a foster care family home or childcare institution.</p>
                <p>The TMBCI LEA shall accept a report of a missing child even if custody has not been formally established. Reporting parties shall be encouraged to obtain legal custody as soon as possible; however, since the safety of the missing child(ren) is paramount, a case will be opened when it can be shown the child has been removed, without explanation, from his or her usual place of residence. If custody has not been established by the Court, law enforcement's only responsibility is to ensure the child is safe.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Computer equipment and programs.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chief of Police shall provide the necessary computer hardware and computer programs to enter, modify, and cancel information on missing and murdered persons in the NCIC database. These programs must provide for search and retrieval of information using the following identifiers: physical description, name, and date of birth, name and Social Security number, name and driver's license number, vehicle license number, and vehicle identification number.</p>
                <p>The Chief of Police shall also provide a system for tribal, regional, statewide, multistate, and nationwide broadcasts of information on missing and murdered persons. These broadcasts shall be made by tribal law enforcement agencies where possible or, in the case of statewide or nationwide broadcasts, by the North Dakota Agency of Emergency Services (NDDES) upon request of the local LEA.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Authority to enter or retrieve information.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>Only the TMBCI LEA, or other law enforcement agency with appropriate jurisdiction, may enter missing and murdered person information into the NCIC computer or retrieve information from the NCIC database.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Statistical data.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chief of Police shall annually compile and make available statistical information on the number of missing and murdered persons entered into the NCIC database and information on the number of missing persons located.  An annual report shall be submitted to the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Chairperson and Tribal Council before the end of each calendar year.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Rules.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chief of Police may adopt rules in conformance with this Title to provide for the orderly collection and entry of missing and murdered person's information and requests for the retrieval of missing and murdered person's information.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Cooperation with other agencies.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Chief of Police shall cooperate with other tribes, counties, states, and federal agencies, including but not limited to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the United States Marshal's Service, and other federal agencies with law enforcement responsibilities, in the exchange of information on missing and murdered persons.</p>
                <p>
                  <strong>MISSING PERSON REPORT; DUTIES OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Initial Report, entry of information, and initial response and investigation.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa (TMBCI) Law Enforcement Agency (LEA) shall accept without delay any report of a missing person. The TMBCI LEA shall not refuse to accept a missing person report on the basis that:</p>
                <ul>

                  <li>the reporting person lacks a familial or other relationship with the missing person; or</li>
                  <li>for any other reason, except in cases where the TMBCI Law Enforcement Agency has direct knowledge that the person is, in fact, not missing and the whereabouts and welfare of the person are known at the time the report is being made.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The TMBCI LEA shall accept missing person reports in person. Reports may also be accepted by telephone, in writing, or other electronic means to the extent that the reporting is consistent with the Agency's policies or practices.</p>
                <p>Upon receiving a report of a person believed to be missing, a TMBCI Law Enforcement Officer shall conduct a preliminary investigation to determine whether the person is missing. If the person is initially determined to be missing and endangered, and their location is not secured, the officer shall immediately consult the Chief of Police, or designee, in recognition of the fact that the first two hours are critical.</p>
                <p>If the person is determined to be missing, the TMBCI LEA shall enter identifying and descriptive information about the person into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) data system within the first two hours of receipt of the initial report.

                <p>When a TMBCI Law Enforcement Investigator receives a report from a TMBCI Law Enforcement Officer via the Chief of Police indicating that a person is missing, the Investigator will lead the TMBCI LEA in conducting the investigation, offering resources, and assisting the Officer in implementing the investigation policy with particular attention to the need for immediate action. The TMBCI LEA shall promptly notify all appropriate law enforcement agencies in the state and, if deemed appropriate, law enforcement agencies in adjacent states or jurisdictions of any information that may aid in the prompt location and safe return of a missing person.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The TMBCI LEA shall not be required to obtain written authorization before it releases publicly any photograph that would aid in the investigation or identification of the missing person.</li>

                  <li>If the person identified in the missing person report remains missing for 30 days, and the additional information and materials specified below have not been received, the TMBCI Law Enforcement Agency shall attempt to obtain:
          <ul><li>DNA samples from family members and, if possible, from the missing person along with any needed documentation, including consent forms, required for the use of federal DNA databases;</li><li>dental information and x-rays, and an authorization to release dental information or x-rays of the missing person;</li><li>any additional photographs of the missing person that may aid the investigation or identification; and</li><li>fingerprints</li></ul></li>
                  <li>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the TMBCI LEA from obtaining any of the materials identified in this section before the 30th day following the filing of the missing person report.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Jurisdictional conflicts are to be avoided when a person is reported missing.

If a person resides in the TMBCI's jurisdiction and was last seen in another jurisdiction, and upon confirmation that the law enforcement agency covering that jurisdiction chooses not to take a missing-person report, the TMBCI LEA will assume reporting and investigative responsibility.</p>

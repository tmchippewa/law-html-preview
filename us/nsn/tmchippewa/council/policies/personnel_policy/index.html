                <p>All Tribal Employees will be paid bi-weekly (every other Friday).</p>
                <p>If a regular scheduled payday falls on a day off (e.g., a holiday) the employee will receive their paycheck on the first workday of work before the regular scheduled payday, subject to preparation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="4B.">B.</span> Deductions</p>
                <p>The law requires threat TMBCI make certain deductions from employee's compensation. Among these are applicable federal and state taxes.  TMBCI must deduct Social Security taxes and Medicare on each employee's earning up to a specified limit that is called the Social Security "wage base."  TMBCI matches the amount of Social Security and Medicare paid by each employee.</p>
                <p>The finance department, payroll department will automatically make applicable deductions from employee's paychecks according to law.  Employees may also authorize in writing to have other deductions made according to tribal financial payroll imitations.</p>

                <p>A cost-of-living increase percentage or incentive may be approved by the Governing Body thru resolution form each year but is not mandated and depends on funding approval and if funding is available.  Each program is responsible for including this increase in their budget and/or refunding grant.  If the money is not included in the budget, the cost of living or incentive will not be approved for hat program or individual.  Only those programs mandated by law to receive a specified percentage will deviate from this policy or as approved by funding agency and concurred by the Governing Body.  (e.g., head start).  Employee must have no less than one (1) year employment as a regular full-time employee to be eligible for a cost-of-living increase.</p>

                <p>Payment for time worked more than the normal workweek (40 hours) is not provided for by the Turtle Mountain Tribe.  If overtime is necessary, compensatory time will be earned and accrued in lieu of overtime pay.  All compensatory time must be authorized in advance by the employee's immediate Supervisor prior to being worked.  (See Chapter 6, Compensatory time) Exempt employees are not eligible for compensatory time or overtime.</p>
                <p>Unused comp-time will not be paid out upon resignation or end of employment.</p>

                <p>Employees are required to use the time clocks.  Employees, exclusively, should punch themselves in and out at their work site.  Tampering with, altering, or falsifying time records, or recording time on another employee's time record will result in disciplinary action, including termination.  Write ins on timecards will not be accepted unless signed off by the Human Resource.  Employees will be required to use leave if they are not punched in or punched out on timecards.  Hours will be calculated by the 8 minutes after the hour upon punch in and 5 minutes before punching out.  If an individual is on travel the supervisors are responsible for accurate and timely completion and submission of all-time sheets and supporting documents including leave slips, compensatory time approval and any other documents as required by the Human Resource department.  Timesheet that are inaccurate will be returned to the Supervisor for correction.</p>
                <p>The TMBCI government is responsible to the people for accurate and appropriate expenditures of government funds.  In order to provide the most effective and efficient use of the people's funds, time clocks are utilized.  The tribe has installed a system of time clocks and cameras to monitor and ensure proper reporting.</p>
                <p>The tribe's workflow system has a feature allowing for individuals to manually punch in and out using their fingerprint or face recognition.  Employees are no longer permitted to write in and submit their time manually.  Occasionally, employees are either not able to physically punch in or punch out, or they may forget.  In this circumstance, the following internal control will be employed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="4G.1.">1.</span> Individuals utilizing the time clock system for payroll are required to punch in and punch out.  All efforts will be made to use the workflow system.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="4G.5.">5.</span> If the employee disagrees with the final determination, the employee can file a grievance per the employee grievance procedure.</p>
                <p>This internal control does not apply to telework that is pre-approved in writing by the Supervisor prior to the date of work.</p>
                <p>It is a violation of TMBCI Code 26.118.04 and Class 4 Offense to tamper with public records.  This includes false entries into a tribal records database.</p>

In such emergency situations, the employee will obtain an early check release form from the Human Resource department.  Supervisor recommends and submits to finance.  Failure to adhere to this process may result in denial of early check release.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="4I.">I.</span> Administrative Pay Corrections</p>
                <p>TMBCI takes all reasonable steps to assure that employees receive the correct amount of pay in each paycheck and that employees are paid promptly on the scheduled payday.</p>
                <p>In the unlikely event that there is an error in the amount of pay, the employee should promptly bring the discrepancy to the attention of Payroll and Human Resource so that correction can be made as quickly as possible.  Once under-payments are identified, they will be corrected in the next regular paycheck.</p>
                <p>Overpayments will also be corrected in the next regular paycheck unless this presents a burden on the employee (where there is a substantial amount owed).  In that case, TMBCI will attempt to arrange a schedule of repayments with the employee to minimize the inconvenience to all involved.</p>

The TMBCI will make every attempt to ensure the grievance procedures are prompt and equitable.  It is the responsibility of the employee to initiate the grievance procedure within five (5) working days of the incident or action.  Failure to comply with this time frame will result in the grievance being rejected by the Supervisor as untimely filed.</p>
                <p>The following process will be adhered to when filing a grievance:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="8D.•">•</span> Any employee who believes that he/she has a justifiable complaint must discuss the complaint with his/her immediate Supervisor.

                <h2 id="9">Chapter 9 Performance Appraisals and Review</h2>
                <p>Evaluation employee performance is a continuous process and integral part of the employee/supervisor relationship.  The TMBCI believes, therefore, that each employee should be regularly informed regarding his or her performance on the job.  To ensure that this appraisal is done as fairly and consistently as possible, the tribe will follow a system for periodically evaluating all employees.  This process will be monitored by the Human Resource department for consistency and effectiveness.</p>
                <p>The performance evaluation system provides a history of work progress of the individual employee with the tribe.  It shall also be utilized as a method to determine eligibility for merit increases, as a basis for discharging an employee and job status.  The Supervisor should use the performance evaluation system as a tool for counseling employees and as a communication tool for discussing work progress, problems, and opportunities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="9A.">A.</span> 90-day Performance Evaluation</p>
                <p>All new employees will be evaluated at the conclusion their 90-day probationary period.  The Supervisor is responsible for completion of a formal 90-day evaluation of the employee's job performance.  If the Supervisor indicates that the employee's job performance is unacceptable or deficient the Supervisor may recommend dismissal within the 90-day probation period or 30 days after completion of the probationary period.</p>
                <p>Unforeseen circumstances may prevent and employee from adequate performance (E.g., death in the family, illness, or other major unforeseen matters).  In this case the Supervisor may extend the evaluation period an additional 30-days.  The Supervisor will inform the employee of any areas of responsibility that may be unacceptable or deficient.  After being notified of deficiencies, the employee must demonstrate that they can meet the minimum standard of performance.  If the employee does not demonstrate improvements in the unacceptable areas, the employee shall be subject to dismissal.  A copy of the evaluation will be kept by the employee, the Supervisor and one will be sent to the Human Resource department.  To be filed in the employee's personnel file.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1"><span class="level-num" id="9B.">B.</span> Annual Performance Evaluations</p>
                <p>Annual performance appraisal time frames begin on the start date of the employee in his/her current position and are due every year thereafter.  Therefore, it is imperative that Supervisors track and maintain the performance appraisal time frames of his/her evaluation date.</p>
                <p>Regular employees whose performance is below satisfactory, as determined by the annual performance review, will be indicated on the evaluation form.  The Supervisor will specify which job elements the employee needs to improve, recommendation for improvements, how the Supervisor will assist the employee to improve, and that employee will be re-evaluated, as determined by the Supervisor, at the end of six (6) months.  Failure by the employee to improve his/he performance will result in appropriate personnel action up to and including termination.</p>
                <p>The Supervisor should complete the evaluation form, sign it, and review it with the employee.  The employee will be asked to sign the evaluation form.  This signature indicates that the information has been communicated and does not necessarily indicate agreement.  If employee refuses to sign the document, the Supervisor will note that the employee refused to sign.  The employee will receive a copy of the evaluation and the original will be placed in the employee's personnel file.</p>
                <p>Employees who disagree with their evaluation may attach to the evaluation a written rebuttal.  The written rebuttal will be placed in the employee's personnel file along with the annual evaluation.</p>
                <p>Employee Request for Increase in Compensation</p>
                <p>To ensure consistency and effectiveness, employees may request an increase in compensation if the following conditions are met:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2"><span class="level-num" id="9B.1.">1.</span> Completion of no less than one (1) year in the position as a regular full-time employee.</p>
